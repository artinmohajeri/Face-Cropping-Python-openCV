# Face Cropping
![orangeLine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/738a1062-a936-4f2b-85b3-57c353c08b34)
### I have used openCV (cv2) library and it's built in CascadeClassifier model to detect faces.
### This project takes an image, removes the background, body, neck and everything else except the face and then, the face will be stored in a file named "cropped_face.jpg"

- note: if the input image has more than one face or no face at all, the app will raise a customized error.
